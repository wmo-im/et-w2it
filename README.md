## Expert Team WIS2 Implementation and Transition
The Expert Team on WIS2 Implementation and Transition focuses on advancing and refining the WIS 2.0 system architecture to support all Earth-system domains. Its work includes developing new types of WIS 2.0 services in response to Membersâ€™ evolving needs and providing clear guidance on the implementation of WIS 2.0 and the phased retirement of legacy systems (GTS/WIS1). Key activities involve establishing and testing global WIS 2.0 services and infrastructure, updating regulatory and technical documentation, identifying areas requiring further standardization, and ensuring close coordination with relevant expert teams. The team also engages with industry partners to promote effective and efficient data exchange among WMO Members.

The work of this Expert Team is organised in the [WIS2 Implementation & Transition workplan (GitHub Project)](https://github.com/orgs/wmo-im/projects/74) - see the [Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/wmo-im/projects/74/views/1). We operate a "parking lot" for future issues to be considered after INFCOM4 (2026Q4) and maintain a list of the issues that we've decided we "won't do". We won't address comments / updates on the issues in the _parking lot_ or the _won't do list_. We'll review the _parking lot_ after INFCOM4. Please talk to ET-W2IT to move an issue off the _parking lot_ or _won't do list_. 

Other SC-IMT Expert / Task teams may request ET-W2IT to review issues by adding them to the **Todo** panel on the [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/wmo-im/projects/74/views/1) and adding a comment to the [workplan project](https://github.com/orgs/wmo-im/projects/74) **status update** requesting review.

ET-W2IT will review Pull Requests for the [WIS2 Cookbook](https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-cookbook/cookbook/wis2-cookbook-DRAFT.html) ([GitHub](https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2-cookbook)) from external contributors. Requests for change to the regulatory material (WIS2 Manual, WIS2 Guide etc.) need to come from WIS2 National Focal Points or Expert/Task Teams within the INFCOM/Standing Committee on Information Management and Technology (SC-IMT). 

Where ET-W2IT decisions require changes to technical specifications, these will be raised as issues in "product repositories" (e.g., for discovery metadata: [wcmp2](https://github.com/wmo-im/wcmp2)) for progression by the relevant Expert/Task Team.
